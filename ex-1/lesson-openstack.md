# Lesson 1: OpenStack Basics

In this lesson, we will introduce OpenStack - the most popular software for
cloud data centres. But before we start with OpenStack, some basics are necessary.

## Research: Hypervisors and Virtual Machines

While we will discuss the concept of virtualisation and virtual machines
in-depth in the lectures, we require some information prior to the hands-on
session. For that reason it is necessary that you get some basic understanding
of virtual machines. 

Please research the web for some definitions. Reading the [wikipedia
page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) is sufficient for the
start. You will get more knowledge in the course of the lecture.

## Question: Hypervisors and Virtual Machines

 - What are the basic tasks of a hypervisor?
 - What are benefits / drawbacks of using virtual machines compared to physical servers?

## Research: Remote Server Management

In the next lesson we will manage a Linux server from remote. If you are not
already familiar, it is now the time to learn the basics about:

 - **Secure Shell (SSH)**: how to use it, how to use key-based authentication
 - **Firewalls**: required protocols/ports for ssh, web access, and PINGs
