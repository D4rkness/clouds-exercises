# Lesson 2: Terraform and cloud-init on OpenStack

Clean up your bw-cloud tenant. *Remove all the virtual machines, the private networking, the router, and the security groups.*
We will now create the mediawiki from scratch - automated!

## Task: Install Terraform on your workstation

Terraform runs on your workstation. It reads a terraform script from your file system, and then connects to the specified cloud platform to create the infrastructure.

Download [1] and install [2] the newest version of Terraform on your workstation. There might be a package for your linux distribution.
