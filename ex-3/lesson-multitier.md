# Exercise 3 - Lesson 2: Multi-tier applications in Cloud Computing

Before we start splitting the mediawiki application, it is necessary to have a
clear understanding of multi-tier architectures.

## Research: What are multi-tier applications?

Do some research on multi-tier architectures and applications. 
You could start with the Wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture.

Finally, have a look at the general architecture of the mediawiki application at https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:MediaWiki_architecture#General_architecture.

## Question: Multi-tier applications

1. Which tiers are typically used in a web-based application?
2. How many tiers has the mediawiki application?
3. Why is it useful to deploy each tier to a separate vm in cloud computing? Or why is it not useful?
