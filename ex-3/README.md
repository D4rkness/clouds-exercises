# Exercise 3

Welcome to exercise 3. This time we will have the following lessons:

 1. [Extend your knowlede about OpenStack: IaaS Networking](lesson-openstacknetworking.md)
 2. [Multi-tier applications in Cloud Computing](lesson-multitier.md)
 3. [Horizontal Scaling and Load Balancing](lesson-loadbalancing.md)

## Lessons learned 
 - OpenStack provides virtual machines, security groups for firewalls, virtual networks and virtual routers.
 - Wikimedia is a two-tier application with a presentation/logic tier and a data tier
 - Horizontal scaling needs a load balancer as central point for user access. The data tier must not be part of the scaled presentation/logic tier.
