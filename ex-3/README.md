# Exercise 3: Scaling and Load Balancing

## Overview

While vertical scaling is limited to a single instance and hence limited to the largest available flavor, this exercise introduces horizontal scalability. 

- OpenStack provides virtual machines, security groups for firewalls, virtual networks and virtual routers.
- Wikimedia is a two-tier application with a presentation/logic tier and a data tier
- Horizontal scaling needs a load balancer as central point for user access. The data tier must not be part of the scaled presentation/logic tier.
