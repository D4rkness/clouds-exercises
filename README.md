# Cloud Computing Exercise

In this practical hands-on you will learn how to work with Cloud computing from Infrastructure as a Service towards Platform as a Service.

## Prerequisits

 * You should be familiar with Linux and Bash, and have a basic understanding of networking with Linux
 * The course assumes that you have access to an OpenStack cloud.


## Before we take off ...

The overall course consists of a set of exercise (see overview below). Each Exercise contains at least one lesson, which itself has steps like *Task* (practical hands-on), *Research* (look up information), or *Question* (validate yourself). Exercises build on top of each other - meaning, to make use of these exercises, stay on track. Let's go!
